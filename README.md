# To-Do List Web Application

## Description

- **Mark Completed Tasks**: Clicking on a task marks it as completed by striking through the text.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can remove tasks from the list by clicking the "X" button next to each task.
- **Persistent Data**: Tasks are saved in local storage, so they are retained after refreshing or closing the browser.
  
## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the web page.
- **CSS3**: For styling the application layout and design.
